# Network Analyzer
This is a repository for storing my current python project related to network analysis. It is still very basic and in development, dubious code quality warning.
Obs: It requires administrator level privileges aka root, due to traceroute. Refer to: https://github.com/ValentinBELYN/icmplib/blob/main/docs/2-functions.md#traceroute
